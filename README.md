# Rossman-drug-store-sales-data-analysis-and-prediction-

Daily Panel data analysis under Time Series scenario is now a attractive but also challenging topic for Statistics, Econometrician mainly for two reasons: 
* the highly varying frequency to model; 
* when objects is too many, it is impractical to work on each's corresponding time series. 

To investigate these obstacles, our group found a specific daily panel data to analyze, the Rossmann drug store data. We assume for all objects, their time series are highly similar and apply the same models and then choose the model by evaluating the prediction. We found that for this data, VAR(p) with p= 28, 30 is a strong model to fit and forecast. Also, by the result of clustering, over 95% objects are clustered into one group, which denote most time series for all the objects that we are working with is very similar or close to each other.
